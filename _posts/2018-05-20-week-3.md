Hello everybody,

The first week of coding period is over and now you might ask how is the project going. I could not say how is it going without being biased, so I am letting you decide.

* Made some changes to Joel's patches conform to reviews. The patches Joel submitted contains the subcommands: `apply`, `drop`, `clear`, `branch`, `pop` and new test cases.

* Converted git stash `list`, `show`, `create` from shell to C.

* Opened a [PR](https://github.com/git/git/pull/495) containing the commits related to git stash (the ones above).

You might ask why the commits weren't sent over mailing list if they are ready. Mainly because there could be brought some improvements (to be more specific, by avoiding spawning another process in favor of using the existing API). At the moment, the API doesn't offer the exact functionality needed, so there will be a patch for this.

Don't forget about #git-devel IRC channel. I would say that it is pretty active and an amazing way to engage with the community. See you there! ;)

Thanks!
