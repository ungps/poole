Hello, everybody!

One more week passed. What is going on? In the last but one blog I talked about "some bugs" and in the last one I got more into details. Since that, I had a very educative discussion with my mentor. Some hightlights:

* Tomrrow I am going to send `GET_OID_GENTLY` as [RFC] patches. Something about them makes me feel a little bit unsecure, but I think that is just because I consider that `get_oid()` to be a little too complex for me.

* Since the `stash` patches could make use of `GET_OID_GENTLY`, a new iteration might be sent later over the mailing list. Of course, I will need to ask Junio what is be the best course of action.

* In the last blog I talked that about `pretty_print_commit()`. There are other better ways to do that (by using `find_commit_subject()` and `get_commit_buffer()`). I think that at first I tried to use `pretty_print_commit()` because, besides the commit subject, I also needed the abbreviated SHA1 (which in the end I did not use). Anyway, this approach is more clear. Thanks, dscho!
