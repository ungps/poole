Hello,

The work on git stash continues. I can not think of something new which I have not said about in the last blog posts. Just maybe that I hope I will finish to convert `create_stash()` this week and the next one `push_stash()` and `save_stash()` (which is deprecated).

I am waiting to get the last patches (which I talked about in the last blog) reviewed. I am aware that the series of patches is substantial (808 lines, to be more specific) and it might take a while for them to get reviewed. But that is ok, I have what to work on! :)

Thanks!
