Hello,

Still waiting for reviews on the patches I submitted over the mailing list last week. There were already some useful comments (thanks!), but I will wait a little bit more to see if anyone else has any other suggestion. While waiting, I "finished" to convert `create_stash()`. There are some bugs regarding it, but I hope I will solve them as soon as possible.

EDIT:

[Here](https://github.com/ungps/git/commits/git-stash) you can find the last 3 commits related
to `git stash create`.

Thanks!
