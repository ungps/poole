Hi,

As you may know from the previous post, the exam period started. I had some spare time between two exams and I did work on the patch I talked about two weeks ago. There are some things which could be improved, so I will be back with a update on this matter (and hopefully a patch). At the beginning of the next week I will have my last exam, and after that... full focus on stash!

Thanks!
