Hello,

During the last week, I have sent some fixup commits for the two branches `get_oid_gently` and `git-stash`. The priority is to get `get_oid_gently` in the perfect form, since it would be a preparatory patch for `git-stash`. I hope I will sent both of them over the mailing list this week.

The last `git stash` commands which are not converted at the moment are: `git stash create`, `git stash push` and `git stash save`. They will be converted in the specified order before, since `push` uses `create` and `save` uses `push`.

Thanks!
