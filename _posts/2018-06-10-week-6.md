Hi,

Now that exams are over, I am planning to focus entirely on the GSoC project. One unplanned part of the project (which I mentioned in last two blog posts) was that there is not any way to call `get_oid()` and avoid `exit()` calls using the existent API. Of course, there could be spawned another process (`git rev-parse`) to do that, but a better way is to add a new functionality to cover the case mentioned before. [Here](https://github.com/git/git/pull/504) you can find a PR containing the progress on this matter and [here](https://github.com/git/git/pull/495) the progress on `git stash` conversion.

Thanks!
