Hello,

You may wonder what is new and what happend last week. I submitted last commands I have been working on over the [mailing list](https://public-inbox.org/git/cover.1529943789.git.ungureanupaulsebastian@gmail.com/). The patches related to `GET_OID_GENTLY`, which I mentioned in the previous post, are not submitted yet, since I focused on porting `git stash create` command. Once this is successfully converted into a builtin, I can start porting one of the most important commands, `git stash push`.

Thanks!
