Hello world,

Today is the last day of community bonding period. How is it going? It has been a busy week with many university assignments (also took part in a programming contest) and did not have as much free time as I hoped. However, this is what I achieved this week:

* Looked more into documentation, [Joel's patches](https://public-inbox.org/git/20180405022810.15796-1-joel@teichroeb.net/) and reviews. Tried to understand the process of conversion by comparing the shell source code and the C code. I started to update the patches and fix issues raised during reviews.

* Had some questions regarding the patch, reviews and Git good practices, which got answered by Johannes Schindelin and Thomas Gummerer (thank you, you are great!).

* Discussed more with Git community members on IRC.

The coding period has officially started and I expect to submit a PR on Github to make it easier for my mentor and the community to review my work.

Don't forget about my colleagues' blogs, [Pratik Karki](https://prertik.github.io/) and [Alban Gruin](https://blog.pa1ch.fr).

Thanks!
